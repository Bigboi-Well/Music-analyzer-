ðŸŽµ Pro Music Analyzer

A professional-level music analysis tool built with Python and Streamlit. Upload your audio files (mp3, wav, ogg) and get a detailed analysis including tempo, key, spectral features, energy, beats, mood, and more. Generate playlists by mood and export features for further use.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Tempo Detection: Beats per minute (BPM)

Key Detection: Musical key of the track

Mood Classification: Energetic, Calm, or Neutral based on RMS and spectral features

Spectral Features:

Spectral Centroid

Spectral Bandwidth

Spectral Contrast

Zero Crossing Rate

Waveform & Frequency Spectrum: Visualize the audio signal

Energy Over Time Plot: RMS energy variation across the track

Beat Overlay Visualization: Shows detected beats on waveform

Playlist Generation: Group songs by mood

Export Audio Features: CSV export for all analyzed features

Performance Optimizations:

Option to analyze only first 30 seconds (faster)

Optional full song analysis

Downsampling to speed up analysis
