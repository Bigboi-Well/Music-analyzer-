ðŸŽµ Pro Music Analyzer

Pro Music Analyzer is a professional-level music analysis tool built with Python and Streamlit. This project was developed as a group assignment under the supervision of a professor during a hands-on workshop on audio and AI technologies.

It allows users to upload audio files and get a detailed analysis including tempo, key, spectral features, energy, beats, mood, and more. Users can also generate playlists based on mood and export analysis results for further use.
